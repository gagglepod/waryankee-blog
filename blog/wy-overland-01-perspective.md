## In This Episode

It's August 2020... Greetings! I am Kyle M. Bondo and this War Yankee - Overland, my American Civil War history podcast that follows General Ulysses S. Grant and the Army of the Potomac on its 47-day, 113-mile military campaign south from Culpeper to Petersburg, Virginia. As the first episode in this War Yankee series, I want to begin with setting some expectations. You may be asking yourself:

- Who is the War Yankee?
- Why the Overland Campaign?
- Why are you starting in the middle of the Civil War?

To answer these questions I begin with some background about myself and my family history that will fill you in on my perspective regarding the American Civil War and what War Yankee will focus on.
