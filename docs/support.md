## Support the War Yankee Podcast
Every episode is a work of passion that requires a lot of coffee. I research, read, visit, host, mix, edit, and produce every episode myself. I would greatly appreciate it if you could do two things for me:

1. Send me a quick note of encouragement at [thewaryankee@gmail.com](mailto:thewaryankee@gmail.com). This keeps me going when times get tough!

2. If you enjoy this podcast, please consider supporting the show by [buying me a cup of coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/waryankee) (or two)!

Thank you for taking the time to listen. You are appreciated!
